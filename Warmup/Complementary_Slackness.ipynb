    "The condition is called \"complementary slackness\". A rather generic definition is given in section 5.2.2 of the Boyd textbook (it also arises in linear programming), but more importantly, its impact for SDPs is described in Example 5.13.\n",

    "In short, this provides a set of equations that are satisfied by the optimal solution of an SDP and its dual: in the notation of Example 5.13, if the primal is\n",

    "  min c*x\n",

    "I join here a short python example that illustrates this phenomenon with cvxpy. Note that the SDP data is chosen randomly in the script, so you can obtain other examples by removing the randomness seed setting, you may just need to try a few attempts because random problems may be either infeasible or unbounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, since you found a meaningful basis of indeterminates for your problem, it might be interesting to work with the SDP matrices in the basis formed by your nullifiers. If Gamma is your matrix in the monomial basis (1, A0, A1, B0, ...), you should be able to construct this matrix by simply performing a change of basis U*Gamma*U^\\dag. What is the structure of the matrix you obtain in this basis?"
